# getting-and-cleaning-data 
# The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 
# You will be required to submit: 
# 1) a tidy data set as described below.
# 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis.
# 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
